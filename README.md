## Motivation
The author was first introduced to the concepts of [gradient noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_noise) and [fractal brownian motion](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/) while attempting to learn how [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) [generated its terrain](https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/). Originally intending to use gradient noise and fractal brownian motion to create 3d virtual worlds [procedurally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation), it became apparent that the concepts could be used to generate interesting visuals if the values (corresponding to terrain heights in most games that utilize gradient noise) had colors associated to "bands" of values / heights.

Typically when gradient noise is used to generate visuals, the resulting images often look like convincing occurrences in nature. Mapping the gradient noise values to blue and white often produces images that look very convincingly like clouds (especially when animated), and mapping to orange and yellow looks very convincingly like lava.

Those visuals, though, map noise values to all possible colors between the two specified colors in the gradient continuously (as opposed to discretely). The author's curiosity was piqued by the idea of what would happen if the noise values were mapped to a very limited subset of all colors values for each "band" of values, instead of just to a continuous spectrum between two pre-specified color values.

After some experimentation, it was learned that the visuals produced are actually quite interesting, especially when the height-bands and parameters for the gradient noise and fractal brownian motion vary with time. The original implementations were all CPU-based, which is exceptionally slow, and thus animations had to be compiled using [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) from hundreds or thousands of individual images or run live but with limited resolution and limited frames per second. It became apparent that the use of GPU [fragment shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/) would massively speed of the calculations needed for such a visualization, making live observation of and interaction with it much more pleasant. The difference in speed cannot be understated - the frames ought to be able to be generated between 100x to 1000x faster, roughly stated.

HyperChromatic Nova thus aims to implement a GPU-accelerated version of this concept in a cross-platform manner, so that one can interact with such visualizations on desktop, browser, or mobile. It facilitates this by using [Haxe](https://haxe.org) and the highly portable, cross-platform library, [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org). Additionally, the project aims to make these visualizations more interesting by allowing interpolation / tweening between different generated visualizations.

## Building and Running
Building a running the project from source requires [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) and [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org/download/) to be present.

Assuming both are present, clone the repository in the typical manner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin-kmetz/hyperchromatic-nova.git
```

From there, if one simply wants to get the program built and running, the following commands can be run from the root directory of the project:

```bash
openfl test <TARGET>
openfl test <linux|mac|windows|html5>
```

If one wants to separately build and run a release build, then the following can be run from the root directory of the project:

```bash
openfl build <target>
openfl run <target>
```

The release generated by the `build` command can be found in the directory `Export/<target>/bin/`.

## Running Unit Tests
Assuming Haxe is installed and the remote repository has been cloned, run the following from the root directory of the project:

```bash
haxe run_tests.hxml
```

## Contributing
Code contributions are not yet welcome on this project, but after its initial release, the project will be welcoming of them. Until that time, please fork/clone the project and modify it in private if one feels inclined to do so.

## Status and Maintenance
Unless this README explicitly states otherwise, this project is being actively maintained, regardless of how much time has elapsed since the last commit or update. If any issues or improvements are needed or desired, feel free to contribute, open an issue, or reach out to the maintainer at [kevin.kmetz@protonmail.com](mailto:kevin.kmetz@protonmail.com).
